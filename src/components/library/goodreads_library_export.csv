A book that is, in principle, all about reading. I've never seen anything that experiments with the format of reading in this way, with fragments of stories within a story. Overall it was quite confusing to the point of needing to Google quick plot summaries, but I respect Calvino for the sheer creativity and craziness he poured into this book. It did confuse me to the brink of frustration and I only finished it out of stubbornness, but overall this was a crazy experiment within the vessel of language that I don't regret picking up.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/><i><br/>You're the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything.<br/><br/>The world is so complicated, tangled, and overloaded that to see into it with any clarity you must prune and prune.<br/></i>",,,1,0

Where to even begin. ""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."" Emerson was right when he said that. This book feels so close, an experience so connected to my own heart (and I'm sure hundreds of thousands of others). Crazy how that can happen, when it details the life of a very specific boy in a very specific environment that I would be lightyears from experiencing in my own reality. But still there were so many moments I had to rewind and bookmark because they felt too real: beautiful, universal truths written defiantly, matter-of-factly in the dirty grunge of the world and cruel life. <br/><br/>Donna Tartt must have had a very sensitive upbringing, where she was exposed to a great amount of experiences (many of those available only to those with extreme wealth) and was able to learn the fine art of appreciating art. That shines through in her writing. Only those who do not have to worry about eating their next meal, or making a desparate salary, have time to let themselves think about experiencing the sublime through art or literature or music. Thinking too much like that can be so, so dangerous—when the mind does not have hard, stupid work to do and is left to wander luxuriously, it often leads its owner to the psych ward. 10000000% the main character could belong in a psych ward, and Tartt writes too vividly to not at least know what it's like to have thoughts like these herself.<br/><br/>But still she does occupy herself with the good, honest, needed work of writing and presents us with this beautiful book. 10 years of her life, finished in only 14 days of mine. In this book was a complete, confident, shining world that she built—truly letting us see the world how she sees it, without the distractions and confusions of someone who isn't as sure or settled spiritually into their own worldview as she most magnificently is. Everything feels right and natural, full of life. Tackling the same themes as David Foster Wallace, or David Lynch, or John Steinbeck, or Haruki Murakami, or anyone else who gets to the heart of balance and equilibrium and nirvana in life. Maybe I'm cherry-picking and letting my own reality get distorted by a strange faith in ""The Way,"" or some kind of big power in the universe, but this book reflects everything perfectly and, most importantly, beautifully. I loved it.<br/><br/><i> Part I - Ch 1 </i><br/>""They want it all as detailed as possible, because whenever you see flies, or insects in a still life—a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple, the painter is giving you a secret message. He's telling you that living things don't last. It's all temporary. Death, in life.""<br/><br/><i> Part I - Ch 4 </i><br/>""What mattered more was the feeling. A rich, sweet undertone so demanding that in class, on the schoolbus, lying in bed trying to think of something safe, or pleasant, some environment or configuration where my chest wasn't tight with anxiety. All I had to do was sink into the bloodwarm current and let myself spin away to the secret place where everything was alright."" <br/><br/><i> Part II - Ch 5 </i><br/>""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed, even under what are called the gains and amusements of mankind."" <br/><br/><i> Part II - Ch 6 </i><br/>""And though, in the clockless, temperature-controlled casino night, words like ""day"" and ""Christmas"" were fairly meaningless constructs, happiness, amidst the loudly clinked glasses didn't seem quite such a doomed or fatal idea.""<br/><br/><i> Part III - Ch 7 </i><br/>""We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves."" - François de La Rochefoucauld<br/><br/><i> Part IV - Ch 9 </i><br/>""Objective value, list value, was meaningless. If a customer came in clueless with money in hand, as most of them did, it didn't matter what the book said, what the expert said, what similar items at Christie's had recently gone for. An object, any object, was worth whatever you could get someone to pay for it.""<br/><br/>""When selling a piece, talking it up (as opposed to sitting back and permitting the unwary to wander into my trap) was a game: to size up a customer and figure out the image they wanted to project. Not so much the people they were—know-it-all decorator, New Jersey housewife, self-conscious gay man—as the people they wanted to be. Even on the highest levels it was all smoke and mirrors.""<br/><br/><i> Part IV - Ch 10 </i><br/>""And it was awful to learn, by having it so suddenly vanish from under me, that all my adult life I'd been privately sustained by a great, hidden, savage joy—the conviction that my whole life was balanced atop a secret that might, at any moment, blow it apart.""<br/><br/>""What you want, to live and be happy in the world, is a woman who has her own life, and lets you have yours.""<br/><br/>""To understand the world at all, sometimes you could only focus on a tiny bit of it, look very hard at what was close to hand, and make it stand in for the whole."" <br/><br/><i> Part V - Ch 11 </i><br/>""We have art in order not to die from the truth."" - Nietzsche<br/><br/>""And in whatever wink of consciousness that remained to me, I felt I understood the secret grandeur of dying. All the knowledge held back from all humankind until the very end. No pain, no fear, magnificent detachment. Lying in state upon the death barge, and receding into grand immensities like an emperor. Gone. Gone. Observing all the distant scurriers on shore. Freed from all the old human pettiness of love, and fear, and grief. And death."" <br/><br/><i> Part V - Ch 12 </i><br/>""It's never the way it seems—all good, all bad. So much easier if it was.""<br/><br/>""Because, what I am trying to say, what I was thinking in the car from Antwerp last night—good doesn't always follow from good deeds. Nor bad deeds result from bad, does it. Even the wise and good cannot see the end of all actions. Scary idea."" <br/><br/>""Why be good? But—this is what took hold of me last night driving here in the car: what if more complicated than that? What if maybe opposite was true as well? Because if bad can sometimes come from good actions, where does it ever say anywhere that only bad can come from bad actions? Maybe sometimes the wrong way is the right way? You can take the wrong path and it still comes out where you want to be?""<br/><br/>""Well, I have to say I personally have never drawn such a sharp line between good and bad as you. For me, that line is often false. The two are never disconnected. One can't exist without the other."" <br/><br/>""As long as I am acting out of love I feel I am doing best I know how."" <br/><br/>""You don't need a point. The point is maybe that the point is too big to see or work around to on our own."" <br/><br/>""The reason I'd liked Boris, and felt happy around him from almost the moment I'd met him, is that he was never afraid. You didn't meet many people who moved freely through the world with such a vigorous contempt for it. And, at the same time, such oddball and unthwartable faith in what, in childhood, he had liked to call 'the planet of Earth.'""<br/><br/>""You know what Picasso says: 'Bad artists copy, good artists steal.' Still, with real greatness there's a jolt at the end of the wire. It doesn't matter how often you grab hold of the line, or how many people have grabbed hold of it before you. It's the same line, fallen from a higher life.""<br/><br/>""Dreams, and signs. Past, and future. Luck, and fate. There wasn't a 'single' meaning. There were many meanings. It was a riddle, expanding out, and out, and out."" <br/><br/>""Idolatry. Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only, if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things, beautiful things, that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another.""<br/><br/>""And the great majority of people it'll never strike in any deep way at all, but a really great painting is fluid enough to work its way into the mind and heart. To all kinds of different angles. In ways that are unique. And very particular. Yours. Yours. I was painted for you.""<br/><br/>""Beauty alters the grain of reality."" <br/><br/>""And I keep thinking too of the more conventional wisdom—namely, that the pursuit of pure beauty is a trap. A fast track to bitterness and sorrow. That beauty has to be wedded to something more meaningful. Only, what is that thing? Why am I made the way I am? Why do I care about all the wrong things, and nothing at all for the right ones? Or, to tip it another way, how can I see so clearly that everything I love or care about is illusion—and yet, for me anyway, all that's worth living for lies in that charm?""<br/><br/>""It's not about outward appearances, but inward significance. A grandeur in the world, but not of the world. A grandeur that the world doesn't understand. That first glimpse of pure otherness, in whose presence you bloom out, and out, and out.

Because, between reality on the one hand, and the point where the mind strikes reality, there's a middle zone. A rainbow edge, where beauty comes into being. Where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not. And this is the space where all art exists. And all magic. And, perhaps I would argue as well, all love."" <br/><br/>""And just as music is the space between notes, just as the stars are beautiful because of the space between them, just as the sun strikes raindrops at a certain angle, and throws a prism of color across the sky, so the space where I exist, and want to keep existing, and to be quite frank I hope I die in, is exactly this middle distance. Where despair struck pure otherness and created something sublime.""<br/><br/>""And that's why I've chosen to write these pages as I've written them. For only by stepping into the middle zone—the poly-chrome edge between truth and untruth—is it tolerable to be here, and writing this, at all.""<br/><br/>""Whatever teaches us to talk to ourselves is important.

This book is purely about the finance world, and how finance controls the world—but it also makes broad statements on humanity and feminism through quite interesting plot twists. <br/><br/>It is very fitting that this was published in the past few years, since money culture and materialism have just become so horrifically bad in modern society—especially with the rise of social media.

Greene literally felt like a cult leader preaching to me because I was entranced. He makes so many astute and resoundingly true observations about past individuals' journeys to mastery—social/behavioral psychology at its absolute finest, though not quite its most scientific. This book will light a fire under you to get your ass up and really live your life.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/><br/>“Conforming to social norms, you will listen more to others than to your own voice. Most often you deviate because of the lure of money, of more immediate prospects of prosperity. Because this does not comply with something deep within you, your interest will lag and eventually the money will not come so easily. Not seeing clearly ahead of you, you will end up in a dead-end career. Even if your material needs are met, you will feel an emptiness inside that you will need to fill with any kind of belief system, drugs, or diversions. You may grow frustrated and depressed, never realizing that the source of it is your alienation from your own creative potential. In the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life’s Task.”<br/><br/>""People get the mind and the quality of brain they deserve through their actions in life. Despite the popularity of genetic explanations for our behavior, scientists are demonstrating the degree to which the brain is actually quite plastic—how our thoughts determine our mental landscape.""<br/><br/>“People who are passive create a mental landscape that is rather barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use.""<br/><br/>""Pushing against the passive trend of these times, you must work to see how far you can extend control of your circumstances and create the kind of mind you desire—not through drugs but through action.”<br/><br/>“Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.”<br/><br/>“In moving toward mastery, you are bringing your mind closer to reality and to life itself. Anything that is alive is in a continual state of change and movement. The creativity that you gain in learning a skill so deeply must be constantly refreshed, as you keep forcing your mind back to a state of openness. The moment that you rest, thinking that you have attained the level you desire, a part of your mind enters a phase of decay. This is a power and intelligence that must be continually renewed or it will die.”<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1<br/><br/>“Too often we make a separation in our lives—there is work and there is life outside work, where we find real pleasure and fulfillment. Work is often seen as a means for making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead. Even if we derive some satisfaction from our careers we still tend to compartmentalize our lives in this way. This is a depressing attitude, because in the end we spend a substantial part of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live. Instead you want to see your work as something more inspiring, as part of your <i>vocation.</i>”<br/><br/>“What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. In the past, it was organized religion that often supplied this. But most of us now live in a secularized world. We human animals are unique—we must build our own world. We do not simply react to events out of biological scripting. But without a sense of direction provided to us, we tend to flounder. We don’t how to fill up and structure our time. There seems to be no defining purpose to our lives. We are perhaps not conscious of this emptiness, but it infects us in all kinds of ways. Feeling that we are called to accomplish something is the most positive way for us to supply this sense of purpose and direction. It is a religious-like quest for each of us.”<br/><br/>“Our times might emphasize equality, which we then mistake for the need for everyone to be the same, but what we really mean by this is the equal chance for people to express their differences, to let a thousand flowers bloom.”<br/><br/><b>“Remember: your Life’s Task is a living, breathing organism. The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.”</b><br/><br/>CHAPTER 2<br/><br/>“The pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents—will you learn how to focus and move past the boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? Much as with physical exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you. Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline.”<br/><br/>“Trying something over and over again grounds you in reality, making you deeply aware of your inadequacies and of what you can accomplish with more work and effort.”<br/><br/>“Learning any kind of skill deeply prepares you for mastery. The sensation of flow and of being a part of the instrument is a precursor to the great pleasures that mastery can bring. In essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. You develop emotionally. Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. <b>Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings.</b>”<br/><br/>“As you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation. <b>Often you must force yourself to initiate such actions or experiments before you think you are ready.</b>”<br/><br/>“The process of learning skills, no matter how virtual, remains the same. In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them—those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn.”<br/><br/>“The paradox is that the mind is essentially free. It can travel anywhere, across time and space. If she kept it confined to her narrow circumstances, it would be her own fault.”<br/><br/><b>“Revert to a feeling of inferiority. If we feel like we know something, our minds close off to other possibilities. We see reflections of the truth we have already assumed. This sense of inferiority gives us a hunger to learn.”</b><br/><br/>“Unlike other animals, we humans retain what is known as neoteny—mental and physical traits of immaturity—well into our adult years. We have the remarkable capability of returning to a childlike spirit. Children's minds are completely open; they pay greater attention. This is why they can learn so quickly and so deeply.""<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3<br/><br/><b>“But true Zen never stops, never congeals into such truths. That is why everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness as a student. Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on clichés and stay there, until the spirit dies as well. Not even enlightenment is enough. You must continually start over and challenge yourself.”</b><br/><br/>“Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. [But] Masters are those who by nature have suffered to get to where they are. ”<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4<br/><br/>“Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.”<br/><br/><b>“The most effective attitude to adopt is one of supreme acceptance. You are an observer of the human comedy, and by being as tolerant as possible, you gain a much greater ability to understand people and to influence their behavior when necessary.”</b><br/><br/>“People will say all kinds of things about their motives and intentions; they are used to dressing things up with words. Their actions, however, say much more about their character, about what is going on underneath the surface.”<br/><br/>“You will encounter thousands of various individuals in your life, and the ability to see them as they are will prove invaluable. Keep in mind, however, that people are in a state of continual flux. You must not let your ideas about them harden into a set impression.”<br/><br/>“You must be particularly careful to never make people feel stupid in your presence. Intelligence is the most sensitive trigger point for envy. It is always wise to occasionally reveal your own insecurities, which will humanize you in other people’s eyes. Self-deprecating humor will work wonders as well.”<br/><br/><b>“When it is time to ask for a favor or help, you must think first of appealing to people’s self-interest in some way.”</b><br/><br/>""See yourself as others see you.""<br/><br/>CHAPTER 5<br/><br/>“If we think deeply about our childhood, not just about our memories of it but how it actually felt, we realize how differently we experienced the world back then. Our minds were completely open, and we entertained all kinds of surprising, original ideas. Things that we now take for granted, things as simple as the night sky or our reflection in a mirror, often caused us to wonder. Not yet having commanded language, we thought in ways that were preverbal—in images and sensations. This mind looked at the world more directly—not through words and received ideas. It was flexible and receptive to new information.”<br/><br/><b>“Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are simply people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood. They are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over, but they have the rigor and discipline to follow their investigations all the way to the end. They retain a childlike excitement about their field and a playful approach, all of which makes the hours of hard work alive and pleasurable. Like children, they are capable of thinking beyond words—visually, spatially, intuitively—and have greater access to preverbal and unconscious forms of mental activity, all of which can account for their surprising ideas and creations.”</b><br/><br/>“Think of everything in nature, or in the world, as a kind of hologram—the smallest part reflecting something essential about the whole. Immersing yourself in details will combat the generalizing tendencies of the brain and bring you closer to reality.”<br/><br/><b> “Truly creative people in all fields can temporarily suspend their ego and simply experience what they are seeing, without the need to assert a judgment, for as long as possible. They are more than ready to find their most cherished opinions contradicted by reality.”</b><br/><br/><i>PART E. REVERT TO PRIMAL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE — VISUAL, NOT LANGUAGE, THINKING</i><br/><br/>“To Leonardo da Vinci, <b>drawing and thinking were synonymous.</b> The hand-brain connection is something deeply wired within us; when we attempt to sketch something we must observe it closely, gaining a feel through our fingers of how to bring it to life. Such practice can help you think in visual terms and free your mind from its constant verbalizations.”<br/><br/>“Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate their thoughts on many levels. What this means is that they are more open to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow themselves a broader range of sense experience. You must expand as well your notion of thinking and creativity beyond the confines of words and intellectualizations. Stimulating your brain and senses from all directions will help unlock your natural creativity and help revive your original mind.”<br/><br/>“After we pass through a rigorous apprenticeship and begin to flex our creative muscles, we cannot help but feel satisfaction in what we have learned and how far we have progressed. We naturally begin to take for granted certain ideas we have learned and developed. Fight this downhill tendency as much as you can by upholding the value of active wonder. Constantly remind yourself of how little you truly know, and of how mysterious the world remains.”<br/><br/>“The best way to neutralize our natural impatience is to cultivate a kind of pleasure in pain—like an athlete, you come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out.”<br/><br/><b>“Sometimes greater danger comes from success and praise than from criticism. If we learn to handle criticism well, it can strengthen us and help us become aware of flaws in our work. Praise generally does harm. Ever so slowly, the emphasis shifts from the joy of the creative process to the love of attention and to our ever-inflating ego. Without realizing it, we alter and shape our work to attract the praise that we crave. What must ultimately motivate you is the work itself and the process.""</b><br/><br/><b>“We are all in search of feeling more connected to reality. We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity. Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create.”</b><br/><br/>“There is nothing that becomes repetitive and boring more quickly than free expression that is not rooted in reality and discipline.”<br/><br/>“Oddly enough, what really makes successful entrepreneurs is not the nature of their idea, or the university they went to, but their actual character—their willingness to adapt their idea and take advantage of possibilities they had not first imagined. This is precisely the trait—<b>fluidity of mind</b>—that Graham had identified in himself and in other inventors. The other essential character trait was <b>supreme tenacity.</b>”<br/><br/>CHAPTER 6<br/><br/>“Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of their relatedness. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.” - Marcus Aurelius<br/><br/>“Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge.”<br/><br/>“Soon, thinking and drawing became fused in his mind. Through drawing things in the world around him, he came to understand them.”<br/><br/>“But anything that is peculiar to our makeup is precisely what we must pay the deepest attention to and lean on in our rise to mastery. Mastery is like swimming—it is too difficult to move forward when we are creating our own resistance or swimming against the current. <b>Know your strengths and move with them.</b>”",,,1,0

History and psychology stripped out of stiff school textbooks into interesting, 3-dimensional stories.

Told in fact-by-fact-history-textbook style. Franklin does not at all come alive like Jobs did in Isaacson's writing.

Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.""</b><br/><br/>Very very very well written. Beautiful in all senses—in a harsh, terrifying, and hedonistic way. Unfortunately I made the mistake of checking out the audiobook narrated by the author herself; although she is clearly brilliant, so so intelligent, and she knows exactly how it was intended to be read (since she wrote it), there is almost too much thinking behind the way she reads. She does not fully lose herself to the words in the way that hotheaded passionate actors can (like David Pittu for her other audiobook); there's a highly academic and intellectual stiffness behind it all, which makes sense because only a mind like that could write a book like this. <br/><br/>Listening to this book was a very vulnerable/depressing experience for me as its events carried on ... I definitely enjoyed <i>The Goldfinch</i> more but these characters certainly set an example for what to avoid in life. Though there are probably things that can be learned from them as well.<br/><br/>At the very core Donna Tartt is someone who appreciates beauty. And it was a nice reminder for me to do that as well—clouds and arching trees and books and blue skies ... a nice reminder to stay grateful ... so that one might escape these peoples' careless, indulgent, and depressing fates.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""After all, the appeal to stop being yourself, even for a little while, is very great. To escape the cognitive mode of experience. To transcend the accident of one's moment of being."" <br/><br/>""People don't pay attention to 90% of what they see.""<br/><br/>""<i>Nihil sub sole novum.</i> Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness.""<br/><br/>""It was the most important night of my life. It enabled me to do what I've always wanted to do most ... <b>To live without thinking.</b>""<br/><br/>""There is nothing wrong with the love of beauty.

This guy is a <b>*good*</b> writer. Unequivocally good — I kept listening on not for the story but really just to witness the crunchy, good, satisfyingly fresh writing.

Serves as a very good reminder that the lightness which promises to bring such sweet relief from all the pains of living is in fact more dangerous than that seemingly wretched heaviness. At least what I got from it is that without anything to tie it down to its own unique qualities and give it shape, life becomes meaningless. I felt so much of this book helped me on a personal level specifically in the stage of life I happen to be at right now, but also sadly I had to remind myself a few times that the beautiful and fortuitous grace of this story is a curated illusion crafted carefully through one writer's artistic lens. <br/><br/>It was a nice reminder to stop seeking high, lofty, shapeless nothings and instead to focus on the things that ground us, to keep ourselves humble in approaching life with a genuine appreciation for just the beauty of living.",,,1,0

Even if only based partly on a true story, it still carries the heavy weight of love: the freedom to choose to love, and the devastation of death to the loved. <br/><br/>Three-dimensional, almost four-dimensional, portrayal of the horrors and inhumanity of slavery, with characters who are so real and so humanized by Morrison.<br/><br/>Morrison pulls on the heavy dilemma to love that (I think) we all feel: the fear that what we love will be broken by the world, scaring us into not wanting to love at all—to not get too attached to parts of this beautiful life, so that when they inevitably fail we won't be dragged down with them.  <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Risky ... for a used-to-be slave woman to love anything that much was dangerous. Especially if it was her children she had settled on to love.<br/><br/>The best thing he knew was to love everything just a little bit. Just a little bit. <br/><br/>So when they broke its back, or shoved it down a sack, then you'd still have a little love left over for the next one.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>But, I want to say thank you to this book. It is really, really powerful. Morrison coaxes the desire, the courage, to love out of the reader again after these 10 hours (I listened to it as an audiobook. Highly recommend, because the author herself reads it with an energy no one else could). <br/><br/>It's our choice to love. And life is beautiful, waiting to be beloved. ",,,1,0

To describe how impactful this was for me, I need to steal a quote from Alan Watts' The Way of Zen:<br/><br/><blockquote><b>Every positive statement about ultimate things must be made in the form of myth, of poetry.</b> What can be described and categorized must always belong to the conventional realm.</blockquote><br/><br/>This book certainly makes many statements about 'ultimate things.' I don't think I can put many of these things into words, but I want to try: to me this book was about the flow of life, the impact of recorded history, and the futile, yet inevitable, conflicts between the social strata that humans divide themselves into.<br/><br/>This last thing caused me the greatest inner turmoil (which is good - thank you, Sra. Allende, for making me uncomfortable and helping me think a little more about my own place in society). The book is told from the perspective of a bourgeoisie upper class family, which was all nice and lovely to read at first because I felt safe in the lavish luxuries that the characters enjoy - no danger of conflict or poverty yet. It's nice to (inevitably) empathize a little with the characters and pretend that you are the one building a massive villa with expensive furniture and a beautiful garden. However, once Esteban Trueba's empire starts to crumble and the revolt of the people occurs, the story swerves rapidly toward uncertainty and feelings of weakness, danger, and pain - it deepens, and here is where it left its mark on me.<br/><br/>You see Trueba reduced to a powerless old man, suffering a bitter loss of the wealth, connections, and political power he spent a lifetime amassing. At the end of the day he is just as desperate as any one of his tenants, whom he abused and treated like stupid animals. All he wants is the safety of his granddaughter Alba - love, at the end of the day, triumphed over all of the riches that he poured his blood and sweat into over the course of his life. So we really are all just the same. Peasants aren't stupid animals and patróns aren't magically elevated to the status of supreme, intellectual beings.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Allende reveals is no need for frustration, or hatred, or any hard feelings, at the way that events play out. Inner peace returns. Everything is part of the design created by the universe. And it is inevitable that one person's part in this design is crueler than others.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Esteban García is a part of the design. He is a crude, twisted line. <b>But no brushstroke is in vain.</b>""</blockquote><br/><br/>This book was a pretty refreshing treat to listen to. Even though it covers horrific torture and violent deaths, it still twinkles with spontaneity, fun, and a real, honest love of the world. This is what really brought the spirits to Clara del Valle Trueba - and to this wonderful book.<br/><br/><blockquote>""She did not believe that the world was a valve of tears, but rather a joke that God had played. And it was idiotic to take it seriously if he himself never had.""</blockquote>",true,,1,0

Time passed very unnaturally (e.g. ten years flash by in a single sentence), and to me the story was quite bland except for the few parts with important symbolism, which unfortunately felt too intentional to be impactful. Not really much of the usual mystique found in Murakami's stories. </i><br/><br/><b> Stories that I've already forgotten:</b> (so I think they could be considered mediocre) <br/>-Birthday Girl <br/>-New York Mining Disaster <br/>-Airplane: Or, How He Talked to Himself as If Reciting Poetry <br/>-The Mirror <br/>-A Folklore for My Generation: A Pre-History of Late-Stage Capitalism <br/>-Man-Eating Cats <br/>-The Seventh Man <br/><br/><b> Final thoughts: </b><br/>Even though the number of standout stars was much smaller than the total number of stories (& there were quite a few mediocre ones), I'm still tipping the overall rating towards the positive side: 4 stars! (Even though the average of all these individual story ratings would probably be 3 stars) <br/><br/>Reading this book (& a few stories in particular) still helped change my mind. It helped me discover powerful universal truths, hidden in the strange stories of tightrope-walking or cooking spaghetti. There were definitely several times when I put the book down to quickly dump thoughts/revelations into my notebook, feeling real, and visceral, connection to the message of a story. <br/><br/>And finally, here's one of the quotes that was most powerful to me: <br/><blockquote>Everything has its 'reasons' ... We just don't notice as we go about our lives. But then at some point we are made to notice ... it rocks you ... Everything, including a stone, knows everything that's inside you ... And all we can do is go with those things. As we take them in, we survive, and deepen.</blockquote><br/>- <i>from</i> ""The Kidney-Shaped Stone That Moves Every Day""",,,1,0

The only story I did not enjoy was “Everywoman.com.” <br/><br/>""Why I Write"" especially changed the way I approach my own writing now. It's such a beautiful, naturally flowing story that tugs on emotions and experiences that I know from my own past - seeing myself in Didion's words was wonderful. (& maybe altered the course of my writing trajectory forever, delivering a much-needed slight shift?) It’s so chock-filled with pinnacle-of-truth advice that I wanted to highlight whole entire pages. <br/><br/>I’d rate Joan Didion's masterful writing 5 stars, but unfortunately I have to rate the book overall only 3 stars because it feels like a pretty miserly grab for profit. The type spacing/margins felt quite weird - much too large, probably just trying to stretch out the short text into a sellable ""book-length"" thing. So future buyers beware, I guess.<br/><br/>Overall though, I'm glad I found this little book squished on a shelf at my local bookstore and took it home with me. That one story ""Why I Write"" was, at the moment in my life when I read it, exactly what I needed to prepare myself for the mountain of essay-writing that awaits me in these next few weeks. So honestly, those 12 thin book pages have redeemed the $24.99 price tag for this tiny little book.<br/><br/>(there’s another pro to this book though: I learned 17 new words while reading this because Joan Didion has the most awesome vocabulary!)<br/><br/><blockquote>""I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. <br/>What I want and what I fear.""<br/> <i>from ""Why I Write""</i> </blockquote>",,,1,0

Little details of mundane life anchor the story (and also are a joy to savor); they help it seem a little more realistic, even when Gregor is undergoing ""incarceration"" in his room as a giant bug. <br/><br/>Gregor's attachment to and love for (and pride in) his family is touching, relatable in its vulnerability. He had quite selflessly hurled himself at bearing the burden of money when asked, letting his family live off of his strained back. But after his bugification, they harbor a natural and quite strong disgust toward his bug form (even though their thoughts toward him stay mostly well-intentioned); poor Gregor. Clearly visible through their treatment of him, Gregor is no longer human. And he himself starts to become aware of his new wants and his new life metamorphosizing into an unknown yet acceptable bug normal. The unfortunate removal of his room's furniture snips his cherished ties to the memories and meaning of his life. Sadly, change in appearance and loss of communication have stripped all hope of connection to his family away from Gregor.<br/><br/>Gregor's metamorphosis draws out the true colors of his family. I found the father quite wicked, a character that spiked hate out of me with his wicked actions because poor Gregor's bug intentions were pure. His young seventeen year old sister is a good, naïve protector, although a little febrile and also inevitably repulsed by poor Gregor. But the family duty is still there- Gregor is still a member of the family. To be simply tolerated. <br/><br/>A little sad to see the family dynamic - stubborn old father overshadowing gentler mother and young sister. <br/><br/><blockquote> ""The things the world requires of poor people, they performed to the utmost, his father running out to get breakfast for the little bank officials, his mother hurling herself at the personal linen of strangers, his sister trotting back and forth behind the desk, doing the bidding of the customers, but that was as far as the strength of the family reached."" </blockquote><br/><br/>And yet, just as Gregor gropes and mopes about his office job at the beginning, he gropes and mopes in his confinement when he no longer has to do the work at all. The burden falls onto the other three in the family (and the old charwoman). To go back to the start of the story, it was quite strange that Gregor seemed unfazed at first after waking up to his bugginess, only thinking complaints about his job to himself - but it was a good introduction to the somber gray shade of his life. Man can always find and magnify a nodule of unhappiness in his life. <br/><br/>The welcoming of tenants into the flat helps draw a depressing contrast with Gregor's treatment as ""family."" A little violin concert, played by the sister, is arranged in the living room for them and lures Gregor out of his dark, dirty room, enticed by the forgotten beauty of humanity. <br/><br/>But poor Gregor's revelry sends the tenants stomping out furiously without paying a penny to their hosts. After all those months a true metamorphosis occurred in the minds of the sister and the parents. The body of Gregor has changed from ""him"" to ""it,"" a monster. Most strongly in the eyes of his sister, that innocent girl who had vainly asserted herself as Gregor's caretaker at first. <br/><br/>But ""He thought back on his family with devotion and love."" And the life leaves Gregor's shrunken body that night, laid belly up in his dirty little room. Finally, perhaps a true alleviation and metamorphosis for the family.<br/><br/>Warm sunshine enters the story for the first time, and in all those months slowly the family's prospects have become quite encouraging. With a bright young daughter, lively and ready for their new life. Strange transformation, after the work has been forced off of Gregor's weary shoulders onto theirs. <br/><br/>Quite slow at the beginning, but worth the investment.<br/>Overall: matter-of-fact, disciplined writing with no flashy distractions. Leaves solid bones for the mind to gnaw at later.<br/><br/><b> A much better examination of this story to read: http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=191,209,0,0,1,0 </b><br/><br/>""Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool""<br/><br/>- ""Curiously enough, Gregor the beetle never found out that he had wings under the hard covering of his back.""<br/>- ""Kafka's art consists in accumulating on the one hand, Gregor's insect features, all the sad detail of his insect disguise, and on the other hand, in keeping vivid and limpid before the reader's eyes Gregor's sweet and subtle human nature.""<br/>- ""Gregor is a human being in an insect's disguise; his family are insects disguised as people. With Gregor's death their insect souls are suddenly aware that they are free to enjoy themselves. "" 'Come in beside us, Grete, for a little while,' said Mrs. Samsa* with a tremulous smile, and Grete, not without looking back at the corpse, followed her parents into their bedroom.'' The charwoman opens the window wide and the air has a certain warmth: it is the end of March when insects come out of hibernation.""<br/>-*In a note in his annotated copy Nabokov observes that after Gregor’s death it is never “father” and “mother” but only Mr. and Mrs. Samsa.<br/>- “The soul has died with Gregor; the healthy young animal takes over. The parasites have fattened themselves on Gregor.”",true,,1,0

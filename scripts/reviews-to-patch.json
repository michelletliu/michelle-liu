    "review": "I know what nothing means, and keep on playing.\n\nDidion writes like an artist. This book was a beautiful sample of the English language ... although also like a powerful drug. It feels so hallucinatory and at a loss with reality—but then again, perhaps art is supposed to show that alternative world to us. The characters are so dysfunctional and yet so capable of existence in their society. This is the type of book that reminds us that it's really never that deep .... that we should play it as it lays."

    "review": "“As the rose-tree is composed of the sweetest flowers and the sharpest thorns, as the heavens are sometimes overcast—alternately tempestuous and serene—so is the life of man intermingled with hopes and fears, with joys and sorrows, with pleasure and pain.”\n\nI enjoyed the principal theory behind this book more than the book itself. I love the idea of the sublime — finding the ultimate beauty when in contrast against terror. However, the execution of this book was quite a dense exploration of the idea and went completely over my head. Self-initiated thinking about the ideas of the sublime and beautiful is a much better experience than absorbing it from this book.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nNothing tends more to the corruption of science than to suffer it to stagnate. These waters must be troubled, before they can exert their virtues"

Feeling grateful to have been able to read this in its native language, English.\n\nThis book borders on the verge of abstraction v.s. realism in writing form ... I couldn't tell what was happening half the time but I guess that adds to the intrigue and mystique. Overall I can see how this impressed the literary critics and won the Pulitzer Prize, and I don't regret powering through the dregs of the middle to get to the brutally honest and reflective ending. \n\nIn another world this would have gotten five stars, but I don't think I'm in the right headspace right now to fully enjoy this strange artistry. Would recommend reading when you are in the mood to fully ruminate on life and art and their mysterious meanings. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuicide is a weapon; that we all know. But what about an art?\n\nHer rebellion and hurt had melted away, deliquesced into a sweet, eternal sunniness that was terrible in the way that life would be terrible, Ted supposed, without death to give it gravitas and shape."

I appreciate the feminist lens through which it criticizes Korean gender standards, but adding in explicit gender statistics about Korean society felt out of place. It really felt like beating the reader over the head instead of allowing them to absorb it themselves through the story."

Not extremely memorable, but still a lovely experience to listen to, uniquely Japanese in its solitary reflections and detail into everyday life.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf a person hasn't ever experienced true despair, she grows old never knowing how to evaluate where she is in life; never understanding what joy really is. I'm grateful for it.\n\nNo matter what, I want to continue living with the awareness that I will die. Without that, I am not alive. \n\nJust when one can't take any more, one sees the moonlight.

    "review": "All things pass. None of us can manage to hold on to anything. In that way, we live our lives.\n\n3.5/5\n\nOne of Murakami's earliest novels, a bit rawer than his later ones but still containing the quintessential beauty of internal dialogue found in all of his work. The plot is certainly strange, but it mirrors real life and shines a light on the mundane in such a refreshing way. Objectively I think this is a wonderful book, so maybe I'm only rating it three ish stars because his other ones have managed to leave a much deeper impression on me.\n\nAs only his 2nd novel ever, this is an extremely impressive stroke of literary genius, as if a baseball had just fallen from the sky and endowed Murakami with the ability to write. (Spoiler: it kind of did...)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWriting is, in effect, the act of verifying the distance between us and the things surrounding us. What we need is not sensitivity, but a measuring stick.\n\nAscribing meaning to life is a piece of cake compared to actually living it.\n\nCivilization is communication. That which is not expressed, doesn't exist.\n\nSometimes I imagine how great it would be if we could live our lives without bothering other people.\n\nJust about anything looks better from a distance.\n\nIs there anything in this world that can't be lost?"

This is a book hooked on fantasies and ideas, promising a tantalizing dream that perhaps never becomes manifested into reality. \n\nPerhaps that's why I didn't like it as much—because instead of satisfying the sublime desire I crave from fiction, this story delivers a very pragmatic reminder ... a call back to Earth. \n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPeople here confuse boredom and stagnation with peace and safety."

It riffs on historical fiction of a brief side quest Michelangelo completed in Constantinople, with characters so rich and dimensional that I find it sad these interactions may not actually have happened.\n\nThe cover design sums it up beautifully: a story from a lost, beautiful age brought back into the modern world through the abstract brushstrokes and brilliant mind of Mathias Énard.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIt's work, above all. Talent is nothing without work. Try it, if you like.\n\nI know that men are children who chase away their despair with anger, their fear with love ... They cling to stories, they shove them in front of them like banners ... You conquer people by telling them of battles, kings, elephants, and marvelous beings; by speaking to them about the happiness they will find beyond death, the bright light that presided over their birth, the angels wheeling around them, the demons menacing them, and love, love, that promise of oblivion and satiety."

Steinbeck always masterfully crafts characters who are a mix of the light and the dark, a reflection of the complexity of real human psyches. There are no heroes or villains, perhaps only the cruelty of the system that manipulates them. \n\nSteinbeck's writing is set against such harsh conditions that it always becomes fiercely optimistic. There is no other way to view the glass than half-full.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second."

Hemingway has such a crisp mastery of the English language that was such a treat to read (or, in my audiobook case, listen) to. \n\nA story full of passion, and warm dripping colors, and the salt of cruel heat. It's quite intriguing to take a peek into the colorful life at the time, but also a little disturbing to witness the sheer amount of gluttony involved. Days full of elite leisure, of not needing to worry about livelihood, seem a requirement to produce this kind of art. Even the ability to consume this type of art is a luxury. Inevitably, unfortunately, that reduced my respect for this book quite a bit. But I guess this decadence applies to nearly all literature, so it's unfair of me to judge.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n“I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it.” “Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.”\n\nNo, nobody ever knows anything.\n\nYou paid some way for everything that was any good.\n\nIf you want people to like you, you have only to spend a little money.\n\nYou know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.

A great book to learn how to develop the mindset of a businessman, tapping into those soft skills that textbooks can't quite teach.\n\nThe book does feel honest and not too ghostwritten, but Wilkinson does tend to have a bit of an ego and is quite out of touch with the way he talks about money. (e.g. only half a million dollars?) The title itself is telling enough, because it seems to be the exact opposite of the altruistic contentment he advocates for by the end of the book. Some people are just wired to be hungry, great businessmen, and Wilkinson seems to be one of them.\n\nI quite enjoyed it just because it opened my eyes to the many inner workings of a company (and many potential failures) that I haven't personally yet experienced. It's inspiring to see a designer become a billionaire for once.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting.\n\nA business was, at its core, about solving problems for other people.\n\nMy sales technique was simple. Be fun to drink with, and ask a ton of questions.\n\nAt conferences I quickly started to learn that the most important business connections were made in bars, gossiping with drunk executives. Buying a round of drinks often generated a huge return on investment.\n\nYou don't know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out.\n\nI realized through it all that in Silicon Valley everyone plays nice, wearing goofy hoodies and padding around in Allbirds, looking like friendly college kids. But inside, most were just as ruthless as their Wall Street counterparts. I soon came to prefer the super-direct pseudo-assholes I worked for over the fake magnanimous ones.\n\nIt's not enough to do what you love.

So rarely is an artist at the peak of their craft like this. This book flows so beautifully and richly in a way that I haven't seen in a while. It was a real treat that I couldn't stop myself from reading greedily, but unfortunately it did leave me in a terrible cloud for a few days from the depressing, but romantic, heartbreak. \n\nI think this is what Kafka meant when he said that A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nCan there be any sweeter intoxication than exerting power and authority over your own kind?\n\nI had yet to learn that nothing in this world can ever match the marvels that we conjure up in our own minds.\n\nTo pity another is to assume superiority. \n\nFor our lives were governed by trivial details.

All I can say is that I am extremely glad that I never read this in high school.\n\nThis book offers a refreshing glimpse into that uniquely Japanese tendency to live completely inside your own head, in your own world. Very rare and precious. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nI wonder if anyone can ever actually stop thinking.\n\nWhat matters is that all the pain, and all the sadness, have meaning. \n\nPeople are always dying.

A disciplined machine (or animal, as he says) with superhuman pain tolerance against the obstacles of achieving his crystal-clear visions. He drops all the secrets to his success so freely here—it's very inspiring to share in his huge hunger, whetting our own. Of course he has his extreme flaws too; there's always the smooth sanguine pride necessary for survival in politics/business/Hollywood, and it is very hard to get over the fact that he cheated on his wife. But the sheer human effort he put into achieving his goals sets a rock-hard example. He was someone who was truly in touch with his inner desires and did what was required to manifest them out into the world. \n\nThis book could have used some cutting and sometimes seems play-by-play ghostwritten—but there's probably a reason why Schwarzenegger did not choose writing as a profession. This book tells a fascinating, otherworldly, and superhuman story. The craziest part is that it's true.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n[My father's] answer to life was discipline ... I never felt that I was good enough, strong enough, smart enough. He let me know that there was always room for improvement. A lot of sons would have been crippled by his demands, but instead the discipline rubbed off on me. I turned it into drive.”\n\nThe vision became so clear in my mind that I felt like it had to happen. There was no alternative. It was this, or nothing.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nI didn't mind basic training. It taught me that something that seems impossible at the start can be achieved.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nAfter that, I never went to a competition to compete. I went to win. Even though I didn’t win every time, that was my mind-set. I became a total animal.\n\nBut I was wild only when I was wild. When it was time to train, I never missed a session.\n\n'The limit is in your mind,' he said. 'Think about it.' And he was right. The limit I thought existed was purely psychological. Now that I've seen someone doing 1000 pounds, I started making leaps in my training. It showed the power of mind over body.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nI was amazed by how much Americans liked to celebrate. I'd never celebrated a birthday until I came to America. I'd never even seen a cake with candles. \n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nIt might seem I was handcuffing myself by setting such specific goals, but it was actually just the opposite. I found it liberating. Knowing exactly where I wanted to end up freed me totally to improvise how to get there.\n\nI learned that staying on top of the hill is harder than climbing it.\n\nOften it's easier to make a decision when you don't know as much because then you can't overthink.\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nJust remember when they say no, you hear yes—and act accordingly. Someone says to you, 'We can't do this movie,' you hug him and say, 'Thank you for believing in me.'\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nI liked the idea of staying hungry in life, and never staying in one place.\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nBut I believe that the only way you become a leading man is by treating yourself like a leading man and working your ass off. If you don't believe in yourself, then how will anyone else believe in you?\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nLook at the faces of people who went through horrible times. Look at the lines, the character in their faces. You can't fake that. These people have principles that they will stand and die for.\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nMy definition of living is to have excitement always. That's the difference between living and existing.\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nDon't go where it's crowded. Go where it's empty. Even though it's harder to get there, that's where you belong, and where there's less competition.\n\nI had a new vision in front of me, and I always feel that if I can see it, and believe it, then I can achieve it.\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nThe more you know, the less you tend to do something.\n\nI'm always comparing life to a climb, not just because there's struggle, but also because I find at least as much joy in the climbing as in reaching the top.\n\nYou can have the greatest movie in the world, but if you don't get it out there, if people don't know about it, you have nothing.\n\nSame with bodybuilding, same with politics. No matter what I did in life, I was aware that you had to sell it. \n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nIf you do something, you want to do it well.\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nI never argued with people who underestimated me. If the accent and the muscles and the movies made people think I was stupid, it worked to my advantage.\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nYou'll get more for being a peacemaker than a warrior.\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nArnold's Rules:\n\n •  Turn your liabilities into assets. \n    It's easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top.\n •  Never follow the crowd. Go where it's empty. \n •  No matter what you do in life, selling is part of it. \n\n“Every time I meet a great person—and I never pass up the chance—I try to ask how they made good and to figure out the angle that has worked for them. I know that there are a thousand keys to success and I love distilling new rules from my experiences and theirs.”\n\n(selections from) 10 PRINCIPLES:\n\n • Never let pride get in your way.\n\n • Don't overthink.\n\nIf you think all the time, the mind cannot relax. The key thing is to let both the mind and the body float. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't use your brain, but part of us also needs to go through life instinctively. By not analyzing everything, you get rid of all the garbage that loads you up and bogs you down.\n\nTurning off your mind is an art.\n\nThe more knowledge you have, the more you are free to rely on your instincts.\n\nThe more you know, the more you hesitate, which is why even the smartest people blow it big time.\n\nA boxer brings a huge amount of knowledge to the ring. But if he were to think about any of those when the punch comes, it would be over. He has to use what he knows in a tenth of a second. When you are not confident of your decision-making process, it will slow you down.\n\n  • Forget Plan B.\n\n“If you’re anxious, instead of making fallback plans, think about the worst that can happen if you fail. How bad would it be? You quickly find out it’s really nothing.”\n\n • Don't blame your parents. \n\n“Sometimes you have to appreciate the very people and circumstances that traumatized you. Today I hail the strictness of my father, and my whole upbringing, and the fact that I didn’t have anything that I wanted in Austria, because those were the very factors that made me hungry.”\n\n • Stay hungry. \n\n“My father always told me, “Be useful. Do something.” He was right. If you have a talent or skill that makes you happy, use it to improve your neighborhood. And if you feel a desire to do more, then go all out. You’ll have plenty of time to rest when you’re in the grave. Live a risky life and a spicy life and like Eleanor Roosevelt said, every day do something that scares you.”"

It was a bit too strong for me back then, but returning to it now (god, 7 years later), I can appreciate it for a much deeper meaning. Life has changed so much since then, going in exactly the opposite way that Bradbury advocates for. This book is like a time machine, back to a golden early age of American culture, before the flashy extreme capitalism and materialism, when good people were quite literally the salt of the earth. \n\nSo sad but inevitable to see the way that times have changed. This book should have unlocked something strange and tender inside me ... but I'm so caught up in my busy, rushed ways that I couldn't let it truly sink in. Life has changed a lot since 7th grade. Now that I finally can understand this book, I can't take the time to enjoy it.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAnd, after all, isn’t that what life is all about, the ability to go around back and come up inside other people’s heads to look out at the damned fool miracle and say: oh, so that’s how you see it!?\n\nA walk on a spring morning is better than an eighty-mile ride in a hopped-up car, you know why? Because it's full of flavors, full of a lot of things growing. You've time to seek and find.\n\nAnd when you're all to yourself that way, you're really yourself for a little while; you get to thinking things through, alone."

    "title": "The Elephant Vanishes",
    "review": "A thing's too close, and you miss it.\n\nThe perfect book to play Murakami bingo with—cats, beautifully formed ears, deep holes/wells, lonesome main characters. This was a short story collection with a few Murakami classics (e.g. the short story version of WUBC) + a few more obscure ones (like the titular The Elephant Vanishes).\n\nMaybe I just wasn't in the mood for Murakami at the moment, but most of these did not strike a chord with me as they usually do. These stories were still a lovely joy to get through, but unfortunately not much resonated. This little book just offered a brief escape into Murakami's perfectly balanced literary world, as always.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSleep\n\nMaybe death is a kind of rest, but reasoning can’t tell us that. The only way to find out what death is is to die. Death can be anything at all.\n\nBarn Burning\n\nA thing's too close, and you miss it.\n\nThe Silence\n\nOne of the things I like about boxing is the depth. That’s what grabbed me. Compared to that, hitting and getting his is no big deal. That’s only the outcome. The same with winning or losing. If you could get to the bottom of the depth, losing doesn’t matter—nothing can hurt you.\n\nIf you make the effort, you get back what you put in."

A bad, careless ending that defied the whole free-spirit point of the entire book.\n\nFavorite quotes:\n\nLess impressed, more involved.\n\nIt is not about being right or wrong, it is about understanding each other...Take notes America!"

    "review": "Wow. This is a book that you will suck up greedily and try to finish all in one sitting. It reads like a beautiful painting. The right texture, the presence—you can really feel all the heart and energy put into this. Magical. True mastery of the craft. I accidentally sped through the entire thing in two days because I couldn't resist, but damn I wish I had given it more time just to let everything seep more beautifully into my mind and its subconscious. This book restores hope to a slower, purer form of life where everything is valued, and loved, just a bit more.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSo how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?\n\nOnly through the hottest fires can purification be achieved.\n\nYou know the greatest lesson of history? It’s that history is whatever the victors say it is. Whoever wins, that’s who decides the history. We act in our own self-interest. Of course we do. Name me a person or a nation who does not. The trick is figuring out where your interests are.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nAfter a while, he is learning, even total darkness is not quite darkness.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nA real diamond, his father used to say, is never entirely free of inclusions. A real diamond is never perfect.\n\nShe remembers something her father said back in Paris, on the first night of the invasion, as they waited for a train. Everyone is looking out for himself.\n\n“Do you know what happens, Etienne, when you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water? It jumps out. But do you know what happens when you put the frog in a pot of cool water and then slowly bring it to a boil? You know what happens then? The frog cooks.”\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nThe total entropy of any system, said Dr. Hauptmann, will decrease only if the entropy of another system will increase. Nature demands symmetry.\n\nIt strikes Werner just then as wondrously futile to build splendid buildings, to make music, to sing songs, to print huge books full of colorful birds in the face of the seismic, engulfing indifference of the world—what pretensions humans have! Why bother to make music when the silence and wind are so much larger?\n\nCHAPTER 10 \n\nWhen I lost my sight, Werner, people said I was brave. When my father left, people said I was brave. But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don’t you do the same?\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nIt is the obliviousness of our children that saves us."

    "review": "Wow. Absolutely beautiful. All the secrets to life, and art, and love, and pain are in this book. Donna Tartt lives up to her literary genius label; words flow and shine in a way that I haven't seen from any other author. Audiobook experience was wonderful; David Pittu brings everything to life at exactly the right pace, really sucks you away. Can drag on at times (maybe the editor was too nice by not wanting to slash out the unneeded, even if well-written, descriptions), but still. Wow.\n\nIdolatry. Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only, if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things, beautiful things, that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another.\n_____________\n\nLong version:\n\nWow wow wow. Where to even begin. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Emerson was right when he said that. This book feels so close, an experience so connected to my own heart (and I'm sure hundreds of thousands of others). Crazy how that can happen, when it details the life of a very specific boy in a very specific environment that I would be lightyears from experiencing in my own reality. But still there were so many moments I had to rewind and bookmark because they felt too real: beautiful, universal truths written defiantly, matter-of-factly in the dirty grunge of the world and cruel life. \n\nDonna Tartt must have had a very sensitive upbringing, where she was exposed to a great amount of experiences (many of those available only to those with extreme wealth) and was able to learn the fine art of appreciating art. That shines through in her writing. Only those who do not have to worry about eating their next meal, or making a desparate salary, have time to let themselves think about experiencing the sublime through art or literature or music. Thinking too much like that can be so, so dangerous—when the mind does not have hard, stupid work to do and is left to wander luxuriously, it often leads its owner to the psych ward. 10000000% the main character could belong in a psych ward, and Tartt writes too vividly to not at least know what it's like to have thoughts like these herself.\n\nBut still she does occupy herself with the good, honest, needed work of writing and presents us with this beautiful book. 10 years of her life, finished in only 14 days of mine. In this book was a complete, confident, shining world that she built—truly letting us see the world how she sees it, without the distractions and confusions of someone who isn't as sure or settled spiritually into their own worldview as she most magnificently is. Everything feels right and natural, full of life. Tackling the same themes as David Foster Wallace, or David Lynch, or John Steinbeck, or Haruki Murakami, or anyone else who gets to the heart of balance and equilibrium and nirvana in life. Maybe I'm cherry-picking and letting my own reality get distorted by a strange faith in The Way, or some kind of big power in the universe, but this book reflects everything perfectly and, most importantly, beautifully. I loved it.\n\n Part I - Ch 1 \nThey want it all as detailed as possible, because whenever you see flies, or insects in a still life—a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple, the painter is giving you a secret message. He's telling you that living things don't last. It's all temporary. Death, in life.\n\n Part I - Ch 4 \nWhat mattered more was the feeling. A rich, sweet undertone so demanding that in class, on the schoolbus, lying in bed trying to think of something safe, or pleasant, some environment or configuration where my chest wasn't tight with anxiety. All I had to do was sink into the bloodwarm current and let myself spin away to the secret place where everything was alright. \n\n Part II - Ch 5 \nThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed, even under what are called the gains and amusements of mankind. \n\n Part II - Ch 6 \nAnd though, in the clockless, temperature-controlled casino night, words like day and Christmas were fairly meaningless constructs, happiness, amidst the loudly clinked glasses didn't seem quite such a doomed or fatal idea.\n\n Part III - Ch 7 \nWe are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves. - François de La Rochefoucauld\n\n Part IV - Ch 9 \nObjective value, list value, was meaningless. If a customer came in clueless with money in hand, as most of them did, it didn't matter what the book said, what the expert said, what similar items at Christie's had recently gone for. An object, any object, was worth whatever you could get someone to pay for it.\n\nWhen selling a piece, talking it up (as opposed to sitting back and permitting the unwary to wander into my trap) was a game: to size up a customer and figure out the image they wanted to project. Not so much the people they were—know-it-all decorator, New Jersey housewife, self-conscious gay man—as the people they wanted to be. Even on the highest levels it was all smoke and mirrors.\n\n Part IV - Ch 10 \nAnd it was awful to learn, by having it so suddenly vanish from under me, that all my adult life I'd been privately sustained by a great, hidden, savage joy—the conviction that my whole life was balanced atop a secret that might, at any moment, blow it apart.\n\nWhat you want, to live and be happy in the world, is a woman who has her own life, and lets you have yours.\n\nTo understand the world at all, sometimes you could only focus on a tiny bit of it, look very hard at what was close to hand, and make it stand in for the whole. \n\n Part V - Ch 11 \nWe have art in order not to die from the truth. - Nietzsche\n\nAnd in whatever wink of consciousness that remained to me, I felt I understood the secret grandeur of dying. All the knowledge held back from all humankind until the very end. No pain, no fear, magnificent detachment. Lying in state upon the death barge, and receding into grand immensities like an emperor. Gone. Gone. Observing all the distant scurriers on shore. Freed from all the old human pettiness of love, and fear, and grief. And death. \n\n Part V - Ch 12 \nIt's never the way it seems—all good, all bad. So much easier if it was.\n\nBecause, what I am trying to say, what I was thinking in the car from Antwerp last night—good doesn't always follow from good deeds. Nor bad deeds result from bad, does it. Even the wise and good cannot see the end of all actions. Scary idea. \n\nWhy be good? But—this is what took hold of me last night driving here in the car: what if more complicated than that? What if maybe opposite was true as well? Because if bad can sometimes come from good actions, where does it ever say anywhere that only bad can come from bad actions? Maybe sometimes the wrong way is the right way? You can take the wrong path and it still comes out where you want to be?\n\nWell, I have to say I personally have never drawn such a sharp line between good and bad as you. For me, that line is often false. The two are never disconnected. One can't exist without the other. \n\nAs long as I am acting out of love I feel I am doing best I know how. \n\nYou don't need a point. The point is maybe that the point is too big to see or work around to on our own. \n\nThe reason I'd liked Boris, and felt happy around him from almost the moment I'd met him, is that he was never afraid. You didn't meet many people who moved freely through the world with such a vigorous contempt for it. And, at the same time, such oddball and unthwartable faith in what, in childhood, he had liked to call 'the planet of Earth.'\n\nYou know what Picasso says: 'Bad artists copy, good artists steal.' Still, with real greatness there's a jolt at the end of the wire. It doesn't matter how often you grab hold of the line, or how many people have grabbed hold of it before you. It's the same line, fallen from a higher life.\n\nDreams, and signs. Past, and future. Luck, and fate. There wasn't a 'single' meaning. There were many meanings. It was a riddle, expanding out, and out, and out. \n\nIdolatry. Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only, if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things, beautiful things, that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another.\n\nAnd the great majority of people it'll never strike in any deep way at all, but a really great painting is fluid enough to work its way into the mind and heart. To all kinds of different angles. In ways that are unique. And very particular. Yours. Yours. I was painted for you.\n\nBeauty alters the grain of reality. \n\nAnd I keep thinking too of the more conventional wisdom—namely, that the pursuit of pure beauty is a trap. A fast track to bitterness and sorrow. That beauty has to be wedded to something more meaningful. Only, what is that thing? Why am I made the way I am? Why do I care about all the wrong things, and nothing at all for the right ones? Or, to tip it another way, how can I see so clearly that everything I love or care about is illusion—and yet, for me anyway, all that's worth living for lies in that charm?\n\nIt's not about outward appearances, but inward significance. A grandeur in the world, but not of the world. A grandeur that the world doesn't understand. That first glimpse of pure otherness, in whose presence you bloom out, and out, and out. A self one does not want. A heart one cannot help.\n\nBecause, if our secrets define us, as opposed to the face we show the world, then the painting was the secret that raised me above the surface of life. And enabled me to know who I am.\n\nI think about something I read about Sargent. How, in portraiture, Sargent always looked for the animal in the sitter.\n\nPaint is paint. And yet also feather and bone. It's the place where reality strikes the ideal. Or a joke becomes serious. And anything serious is a joke. The magic point where every idea and its opposite are equally true.\n\nAnd I'm hoping there's some larger truth about suffering here. Or at least, my understanding of it. Although I've come to realize that the only truths that matter to me are the ones I don't, and can't, understand.\n\nBecause, here's the truth. Life is catastrophe. The basic fact of existence—of walking around trying to feed ourselves and find friends and whatever else we do—is catastrophe.\n\nBut does it make any sense at all to know that it ends badly for all of us? Even the happiest of us? And that we all lose everything that matters to us in the end? And yet to know as well, despite all this, as cruelly as the game is stacked, that it's possible to play it with a kind of joy? To try to make some meaning out of all this seems unbelievably quaint. Maybe I only see a pattern because I've been staring too long. But then again, to paraphrase Boris—maybe I see a pattern because it's there. \n\nAnd as much as I'd like to believe that there's a truth beyond illusion, I've come to believe that there's no truth beyond illusion. Because, between reality on the one hand, and the point where the mind strikes reality, there's a middle zone. A rainbow edge, where beauty comes into being. Where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not. And this is the space where all art exists. And all magic. And, perhaps I would argue as well, all love. \n\nAnd just as music is the space between notes, just as the stars are beautiful because of the space between them, just as the sun strikes raindrops at a certain angle, and throws a prism of color across the sky, so the space where I exist, and want to keep existing, and to be quite frank I hope I die in, is exactly this middle distance. Where despair struck pure otherness and created something sublime.\n\nAnd that's why I've chosen to write these pages as I've written them. For only by stepping into the middle zone—the poly-chrome edge between truth and untruth—is it tolerable to be here, and writing this, at all.\n\nWhatever teaches us to talk to ourselves is important. Whatever teaches ourselves to sing ourselves out of despair."

Rogues is a collection of some of the most intriguing articles that PRK has written in his career. However, I fear that most of the articles in this book were just interesting stories that failed to resonate with me in terms of a deeper meaning. It just seems like he is recounting a play-by-play, something similar to what I could have gained from reading a Wikipedia article. \n\nI also found myself experiencing the same problem I had with his other book (Empire of Pain)—why write the book when the story isn't even finished? I wish that he had waited a bit to recount some of these stories with more resolution (especially the Bourdain article ...).\n\nOverall, I still would read another Radden Keefe book just due to his sheer mastery of the writing skill—and out of respect for the beautiful deliciously way he rendered his story on Anthony Bourdain. If there is any article that you read in this book, let it be Anthony Bourdain's Moveable Feast."

Tanizaki presents a perspective so drastically different from the doctrines of the West. Who’s to say which perspective is correct … but as a society that champions the undeniable goodness of light, it is fascinating to remember the necessity of darkness as well.\n\nThis may be confirmation bias because I will gladly eat up every book that touches upon the concept of a yin-yang, but I found this to be a timeless masterpiece that still holds true 90 years later. Just imagine if Tanizaki had heard of these glowing little prisms of electric light that we call iPhones today … truly destroying the magical world of shadows."

Kindness and wickedness are defined as sharply distinct and XOR in these stories (& the characters' fates fall in accordance with their behavior on the ends of these two extremes). I'm glad they reminded me of the days when I would choose kindness & hard work in poverty over wickedness & idleness in riches - and in these stories there is always gold or a prince waiting on the other side for those with a good heart.  \n\nAlso nice to read stories with a little more weight than some of their glorified Disney counterparts - the G in Grimm most definitely does not stand for General Audiences. \n\nMost enjoyed: The Elves and The Cobbler, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow-White and Rose-Red, Cinderella (but this one takes last place on the list because of the chopped-off toe and bloody heel) \n\nMost questionable morals: The Wolf and The Seven Goslings, The Three Luck Children, Briar Rose, The Gold Spinner, The Twelve Huntsmen, The Town Musicians"

You can tell it was written from a different time that we are slowly losing. (Sad, but, as Siddhartha suggests, a truth we should accept as inevitable)\n\nEveryone takes. Everyone gives. Such is life.\n\nThe opposite of every truth is just as true. \n\nTime is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often again. And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between evil and good, is also a deception."

However, so depressing and futile that I really can't bump it up to 5 stars. How do people live with these thoughts, as the main characters do, and accomplish anything with their lives? Maybe it's my Western capitalism brainwashing kicking in, but I can't stand for this story of characters who just live off their inherited wealth and do nothing of value all day. If anything, perhaps Sōseki is trying to make a commentary on how living uselessly just leads to self-inflicted harms and death? And also perhaps a comment on the nature of human beings—neither inherently good nor bad, but just blank slates which over time the ruinous world can stain with dark terrible ink.\n\nIt's a bad thing not to have a struggle for one's living.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nMy heart, which until then had felt tight with pain and fear, seemed to find relief in sorrow."

'beautiful' isn't the right word, but something close to that. I remember loving his writing in high school because it was easy to share the same viewpoint as his characters. But when for some strange unshakable reason you now believe that life is worth living, you can't appreciate his writing in the same way. Anyone who takes this book to heart, and not as a work of art, might meet the same dangerous fate as the spoiled aristocrat main characters.\n\nYou can't seem to separate the art from the artist in the situation. Dazai is such a strange, strange man. So horrifyingly dark at times, yet also so full of gentle light.\n\nLast year, nothing happened. The year before, nothing happened. And the year before that, nothing happened.\n\nWe all remain children, no matter how much time goes by. We don't understand anything."

It's always an indulgent treat to immerse myself in Murakami's world, a world that fits my philosophies so perfectly—but sadly it's important to remember there is a difference between reality in books and reality in life. This was a beautiful short sweet treat—makes you think about and feel and notice so many new things. leaves a wonderful aftertaste.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n'Tobacco's a killer.' \n'Being alive is a killer, if you think about it.'\n\nMaybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart."

I don't want to think any more, I am because I think that I don't want to be, I think that I . . . because . . . ugh!”\n\nThis book genuinely feels like nausea. A very fitting title. Written as a series of fragmented journal entries, it feels very stream-of-conscious and meta—so much to the point where I couldn't grasp anything that was going on. It's a chaotic mix of not just strange but also mundane events, all seen through the eyes of a not-very-mentally-stable narrator. \n\nWhile I didn't understand what was happening in this character's outside world, there were a few golden lines to be picked out of the narrator's remarkable internal self-reflections (very meta). I didn't enjoy it very much, but I think that might be the point—who is supposed to enjoy the feeling of nausea?\n\n----------------------------------\n\nLife has a meaning if we choose to give it one.\n\nOnce right has taken ahold of a man, exorcism cannot drive it out.\n\nPerhaps there is nothing in the world I cling to as much as this feeling of adventure.\n\nBut everything changes when you tell about life; it's a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories.

It wasn’t love, heaven forbid, nor glory, nor wealth. It was … anyway, I had imagined that at certain moments my life could take on a rare and precious quality.\n\nI am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. There are reasonable hypotheses that take facts into account: but I am all too aware that they come from me, that they are simply a way of unifying my knowledge."

This is why it’s a fiction. \n\nWell-written, no doubt, and gives genius insights into life through the lens of ... finance, I guess. This book is purely about the finance world, and how finance controls the world—but it also makes broad statements on humanity and feminism through quite interesting plot twists. \n\nIt is very fitting that this was published in the past few years, since money culture and materialism have just become so horrifically bad in modern society—especially with the rise of social media. I almost feel disgusted by the sheer amount of wealth this book butters the reader up with, since it feels so self-aggrandizing to read through these pages through the lens of such elite socialite characters.\n\nAlthough Hernan Diaz is undeniably a good writer, very talented with words, I remember feeling lost at the purpose of this book after finishing it. It just seems to serve as entertainment to feed into our obsession with wealth and money as a society. Especially after living in LA for a bit, I feel like the subject matter of this book can be very dangerous—I have never felt less grounded in humble reality and instead feel constantly swept away by waves of materialistic fucking chaos.\n\nI guess this book just fits relevantly into the terrible culture of greed and flashiness that our society continues to magnify through social media, so it won the nice (flashy, haha) Pulitzer Prize. It makes me anxious just thinking about this, which is why I didn't give this book a full five stars, but I guess I just need to face the inevitable reality of our greed-driven, money-loving society.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe ideal conditions for business were never given. One had to create them.\n\nWhenever we found ourselves walking along the waterfront, he would point at lower Manhattan, tracing the skyline with his finger while explaining that none of it really existed. 'A mirage,' he called it. 'Despite all those tall buildings—despite all that steel and concrete—Wall Street was,' he said, 'a fiction'. . . . 'Stock, shares, and all that garbage are just claims to future value. So if money is fiction, finance capital is the fiction of a fiction. That’s what all those criminals trade in: fictions.'\n\nFiction, harmless? Look at religion. Fiction harmless? Look at the oppressed masses content with their lot because they have embraced the lies imposed on them. History itself is just a fiction-a fiction with an army. And reality? Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget. And how is reality funded? With yet another fiction: money. Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we've all agreed to support. We can differ on other matters, like creed or political affiliations, but we all agree on the fiction of money and that this abstraction represents concrete goods. \n\nMoney is not one thing. It is, potentially, all things. And for this reason it is unrelated to all things.\n\nThe closer one is to the source of power, the quieter it gets.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances, there is always room for individual action.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n03.07.24:\nhmmm idk yet.

Not love, only lust. \n\nI guess, for every beautiful A24 movie you experience, you just have to come across a few flashy but tasteless blockbusters too.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe older I get, the less I understand. \n\n'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.'

    "title": "Mastery",
    "review": "“One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself. — LEONARDO DA VINCI\n\nNot a perfect book by any means but the meat of this book is so critical to a meaningful life that it had to join the 5-star shelf for me. Greene literally felt like a cult leader preaching to me because I was entranced. He makes so many astute and resoundingly true observations about past individuals' journeys to mastery—social/behavioral psychology at its absolute finest, though not quite its most scientific. This book will light a fire under you to get your ass up and really live your life.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. - Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n“Conforming to social norms, you will listen more to others than to your own voice. Most often you deviate because of the lure of money, of more immediate prospects of prosperity. Because this does not comply with something deep within you, your interest will lag and eventually the money will not come so easily. Not seeing clearly ahead of you, you will end up in a dead-end career. Even if your material needs are met, you will feel an emptiness inside that you will need to fill with any kind of belief system, drugs, or diversions. You may grow frustrated and depressed, never realizing that the source of it is your alienation from your own creative potential. In the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life’s Task.”\n\nPeople get the mind and the quality of brain they deserve through their actions in life. Despite the popularity of genetic explanations for our behavior, scientists are demonstrating the degree to which the brain is actually quite plastic—how our thoughts determine our mental landscape.\n\n“People who are passive create a mental landscape that is rather barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use.\n\nPushing against the passive trend of these times, you must work to see how far you can extend control of your circumstances and create the kind of mind you desire—not through drugs but through action.”\n\n“Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.”\n\n“In moving toward mastery, you are bringing your mind closer to reality and to life itself. Anything that is alive is in a continual state of change and movement. The creativity that you gain in learning a skill so deeply must be constantly refreshed, as you keep forcing your mind back to a state of openness. The moment that you rest, thinking that you have attained the level you desire, a part of your mind enters a phase of decay. This is a power and intelligence that must be continually renewed or it will die.”\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n“Too often we make a separation in our lives—there is work and there is life outside work, where we find real pleasure and fulfillment. Work is often seen as a means for making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead. Even if we derive some satisfaction from our careers we still tend to compartmentalize our lives in this way. This is a depressing attitude, because in the end we spend a substantial part of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live. Instead you want to see your work as something more inspiring, as part of your vocation.”\n\n“What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. In the past, it was organized religion that often supplied this. But most of us now live in a secularized world. We human animals are unique—we must build our own world. We do not simply react to events out of biological scripting. But without a sense of direction provided to us, we tend to flounder. We don’t how to fill up and structure our time. There seems to be no defining purpose to our lives. We are perhaps not conscious of this emptiness, but it infects us in all kinds of ways. Feeling that we are called to accomplish something is the most positive way for us to supply this sense of purpose and direction. It is a religious-like quest for each of us.”\n\n“Our times might emphasize equality, which we then mistake for the need for everyone to be the same, but what we really mean by this is the equal chance for people to express their differences, to let a thousand flowers bloom.”\n\n“Remember: your Life’s Task is a living, breathing organism. The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.”\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n“The pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents—will you learn how to focus and move past the boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? Much as with physical exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you. Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline.”\n\n“Trying something over and over again grounds you in reality, making you deeply aware of your inadequacies and of what you can accomplish with more work and effort.”\n\n“Learning any kind of skill deeply prepares you for mastery. The sensation of flow and of being a part of the instrument is a precursor to the great pleasures that mastery can bring. In essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. You develop emotionally. Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings.”\n\n“As you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation. Often you must force yourself to initiate such actions or experiments before you think you are ready.”\n\n“The process of learning skills, no matter how virtual, remains the same. In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them—those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn.”\n\n“The paradox is that the mind is essentially free. It can travel anywhere, across time and space. If she kept it confined to her narrow circumstances, it would be her own fault.”\n\n“Revert to a feeling of inferiority. If we feel like we know something, our minds close off to other possibilities. We see reflections of the truth we have already assumed. This sense of inferiority gives us a hunger to learn.”\n\n“Unlike other animals, we humans retain what is known as neoteny—mental and physical traits of immaturity—well into our adult years. We have the remarkable capability of returning to a childlike spirit. Children's minds are completely open; they pay greater attention. This is why they can learn so quickly and so deeply.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n“But true Zen never stops, never congeals into such truths. That is why everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness as a student. Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on clichés and stay there, until the spirit dies as well. Not even enlightenment is enough. You must continually start over and challenge yourself.”\n\n“Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. [But] Masters are those who by nature have suffered to get to where they are. ”\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n“Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.”\n\n“The most effective attitude to adopt is one of supreme acceptance. You are an observer of the human comedy, and by being as tolerant as possible, you gain a much greater ability to understand people and to influence their behavior when necessary.”\n\n“People will say all kinds of things about their motives and intentions; they are used to dressing things up with words. Their actions, however, say much more about their character, about what is going on underneath the surface.”\n\n“You will encounter thousands of various individuals in your life, and the ability to see them as they are will prove invaluable. Keep in mind, however, that people are in a state of continual flux. You must not let your ideas about them harden into a set impression.”\n\n“You must be particularly careful to never make people feel stupid in your presence. Intelligence is the most sensitive trigger point for envy. It is always wise to occasionally reveal your own insecurities, which will humanize you in other people’s eyes. Self-deprecating humor will work wonders as well.”\n\n“When it is time to ask for a favor or help, you must think first of appealing to people’s self-interest in some way.”\n\nSee yourself as others see you.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n“If we think deeply about our childhood, not just about our memories of it but how it actually felt, we realize how differently we experienced the world back then. Our minds were completely open, and we entertained all kinds of surprising, original ideas. Things that we now take for granted, things as simple as the night sky or our reflection in a mirror, often caused us to wonder. Not yet having commanded language, we thought in ways that were preverbal—in images and sensations. This mind looked at the world more directly—not through words and received ideas. It was flexible and receptive to new information.”\n\n“Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are simply people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood. They are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over, but they have the rigor and discipline to follow their investigations all the way to the end. They retain a childlike excitement about their field and a playful approach, all of which makes the hours of hard work alive and pleasurable. Like children, they are capable of thinking beyond words—visually, spatially, intuitively—and have greater access to preverbal and unconscious forms of mental activity, all of which can account for their surprising ideas and creations.”\n\n“Think of everything in nature, or in the world, as a kind of hologram—the smallest part reflecting something essential about the whole. Immersing yourself in details will combat the generalizing tendencies of the brain and bring you closer to reality.”\n\n “Truly creative people in all fields can temporarily suspend their ego and simply experience what they are seeing, without the need to assert a judgment, for as long as possible. They are more than ready to find their most cherished opinions contradicted by reality.”\n\nPART E. REVERT TO PRIMAL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE — VISUAL, NOT LANGUAGE, THINKING\n\n“To Leonardo da Vinci, drawing and thinking were synonymous. The hand-brain connection is something deeply wired within us; when we attempt to sketch something we must observe it closely, gaining a feel through our fingers of how to bring it to life. Such practice can help you think in visual terms and free your mind from its constant verbalizations.”\n\n“Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate their thoughts on many levels. What this means is that they are more open to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow themselves a broader range of sense experience. You must expand as well your notion of thinking and creativity beyond the confines of words and intellectualizations. Stimulating your brain and senses from all directions will help unlock your natural creativity and help revive your original mind.”\n\n“After we pass through a rigorous apprenticeship and begin to flex our creative muscles, we cannot help but feel satisfaction in what we have learned and how far we have progressed. We naturally begin to take for granted certain ideas we have learned and developed. Fight this downhill tendency as much as you can by upholding the value of active wonder. Constantly remind yourself of how little you truly know, and of how mysterious the world remains.”\n\n“The best way to neutralize our natural impatience is to cultivate a kind of pleasure in pain—like an athlete, you come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out.”\n\n“Sometimes greater danger comes from success and praise than from criticism. If we learn to handle criticism well, it can strengthen us and help us become aware of flaws in our work. Praise generally does harm. Ever so slowly, the emphasis shifts from the joy of the creative process to the love of attention and to our ever-inflating ego. Without realizing it, we alter and shape our work to attract the praise that we crave. What must ultimately motivate you is the work itself and the process.\n\n“We are all in search of feeling more connected to reality. We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity. Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create.”\n\n“There is nothing that becomes repetitive and boring more quickly than free expression that is not rooted in reality and discipline.”\n\n“Oddly enough, what really makes successful entrepreneurs is not the nature of their idea, or the university they went to, but their actual character—their willingness to adapt their idea and take advantage of possibilities they had not first imagined. This is precisely the trait—fluidity of mind—that Graham had identified in himself and in other inventors. The other essential character trait was supreme tenacity.”\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n“Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of their relatedness. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.” - Marcus Aurelius\n\n“Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge.”\n\n“Soon, thinking and drawing became fused in his mind. Through drawing things in the world around him, he came to understand them.”\n\n“But anything that is peculiar to our makeup is precisely what we must pay the deepest attention to and lean on in our rise to mastery. Mastery is like swimming—it is too difficult to move forward when we are creating our own resistance or swimming against the current. Know your strengths and move with them.”"

    "review": "“How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people's collective imagination.”\n\nFascinating survey of all sorts of things related to the nature of being human. History and psychology stripped out of stiff school textbooks into interesting, 3-dimensional stories. I liked the conversational, never-overbearing tone; Harari completely upends the commonly accepted views ingrained deep within Western/globalized societies and yet makes you think you did all the hard work and thinking by yourself. This is a very intelligent man with the acute ability to observe things as they are, not as we make them up to be in our heads. It's just funny to realize that the entire systems of our societies, our nations, our empires—are all built upon myths. It all comes down to stories. This book has a few nice snippets of many good ones. \n\n----------------------------------\nCH 1: AN ANIMAL OF NO SIGNIFICANCE \n\n“Most mammals emerge from the womb like glazed earthenware emerging from a kiln – any attempt at remoulding will scratch or break them. Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom”\n\nCH 2: THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE\n\n“How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.”\n\n“Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people's collective imagination.”\n\nCH 8: THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN HISTORY\n\n“'Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realize some possibilities while forbidding others.”\n\nCH 9: THE ARROW OF HISTORY\n\n“Consistency is the playground of dull minds.”\n\nCH 10: THE SCENT OF MONEY\n\n“Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation.”\n\nCH 12: THE LAW OF RELIGION\n\n“Humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in contradictions.”\n\n“If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.”\n\n“A person who does not crave cannot suffer.”\n\nCH 16: THE CAPITALIST CREED\n\n“What enables banks – and the entire economy – to survive and flourish is our trust in the future. This trust is the sole backing for most of the money in the world. The fact is, it’s not a deception, but rather a tribute to the amazing abilities of the human imagination.”\n\n“Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future. It’s founded on the assumption that our future resources are sure to be far more abundant than our present resources. A host of new and wonderful opportunities open up if we can build things in the present using future income.”\n\nCH 19: AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER\n\n“Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden.”\n\n“One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little significance.”\n\n“Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of.”\n\n“But the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.”\n\n“Prophets, poets and philosophers realised thousands of years ago that being satisfied with what you already have is far more important than getting more of what you want. Still, it’s nice when modern research – bolstered by lots of numbers and charts – reaches the same conclusions the ancients did.”\n\n“As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how.”\n\n“A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.”\n\n“Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?”"

    "review": "The man who lives by his labor is at least free.\n\nExtraordinarily boring. Told in fact-by-fact-history-textbook style. Franklin does not at all come alive like Jobs did in Isaacson's writing. Probably because Franklin died a few hundred years ago (and Isaacson never talked to him live), but in this book there's only a sense of Franklin as a stiff 2D cardboard cutout rather than a real person. Franklin's genius and industriousness is still admirable, but I found it strange how Isaacson tried to cover up his blatant disloyalty to his wife. Heavily biased narration for sure, but there were still a few gems of wisdom. \n\nFavorite Franklin quotes:\n\nCH 2: PILGRIM'S PROGRESS\n\nIndustry and frugality are the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue.\n\nCH 3: JOURNEYMAN\n\nSo convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.\n\nPeople are more likely to admire your work if you are able to keep them from feeling jealous of you.\n\nSince pain, naturally and infallibly, produces a pleasure in proportion to it, every individual creature must, in any state of life, have an equal quantity of each.\n\nCH 4: PRINTER\n\nKnowledge was obtained rather by the use of the ear than of the tongue.\n\nSuch is the vanity of mankind that minding what others say is a much surer way of pleasing them than talking well ourselves.\n\nEarly to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\n\nCH 5: PUBLIC CITIZEN\n\nPeople will eventually give you the credit if you don't try to claim it at the time. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will eventually be amply repaid.\n\nI would rather have it said 'He lived usefully' than 'He died rich.'\n\nCH 8: TROUBLED WATERS\n\nThe man who lives by his labor is at least free.\n\nCH 15: PEACEMAKER\n\nIn America, people do not inquire of a stranger 'What is he?' but 'What can he do?\n\nIndustry and constant employment are great preservatives of moral and virtue."

Maybe a three-star book on the Murakami scale, but four stars in general among the wider range of literature. Not mediocre at all (except for maybe like one story).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCream\n\nThere's nothing worth getting in this world that you can get easily.\n\nThe cream of the cream. It means the best of the best. The most important essence of life. That's the créme de la créme.\n\n(I still remember this story clearly after first reading it 5 years ago—this was the cream of all his short stories for me so far.)\n\nOn a Stone Pillow\n\nLoving someone is like having a mental illness that's not covered by health insurance.\n\nCarnaval\n\nThis might sound like a banal opinion, but the world can turn upside down depending on the way we look at it. \n\nThe way a ray of sunshine falls on something can change shadow to light, or light to shadow. A positive becomes a negative, a negative a positive.\n\nBeneath an evil spirit mask lies the natural face of an angel. Beneath an angel's mask lies the face of an evil spirit. It's impossible to have just one or the other. That's who we are.\n\nHappiness is always a relative thing, don't you think?\n\nThe Yakult Swallows Poetry Collection\n\nIt's true that life brings us far more defeats than victories. And real life wisdom arises not so much from knowing how we might beat someone as from learning how to accept defeat with grace.\n\nWhether the team wins or loses, I loved the time spent there most of all. Of course, winning is much better than losing. But winning or losing doesn't affect the weight and value of the time. It's the same time either way. A minute is a minute, an hour is an hour. We need to cherish it. We need to deftly reconcile ourselves with time and leave behind as many precious memories as we can. That's what's the most valuable."

What I knew personally to be true had come to seem unrelated to the process of persuading others. I did not, any longer, want to persuade anyone of anything.”\n\nI am somewhat confused. This book is certainly an outline—since it is not quite a coherent story. It has just the most beautifully rendered snippets and sketches of life—like a fascinating little sketchbook, but not a completed refined painting. It's still very interesting to peer into Cusk's mind like that though; she has brilliant writing technique & paints vivid, advanced pictures. Perhaps I was just not in the right headspace to fully receive her work. Outline was full of cute little vignettes, yet just not quite the heart-gripping story I have been finding myself wanting recently.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI always expected that at some point they would realize the distress was unnecessary and they would choose to avoid it, but they never did. The memory of suffering had no effect whatever on what they elected to do. On the contrary, it compelled them to repeat it. For the suffering was the magic that caused the object to come back and allowed the delight in dropping it to become possible again.\n\n“As it happened, I was no longer interested in literature as a form of snobbery or even self-definition.

You saw the world with less troubled eyes.\n\nI suppose it's a bit like marriage. You build a whole structure on a period of intensity that's never repeated. It's the basis of your faith, and you sometimes doubt it, but you never renounce it because too much of your life stands on that ground. \n\nWhat I miss is the discipline itself. In a way I don't care what I write. I just want that feeling of being in sync again, body and mind.\n\nThat's writing for you. When you make space for passion, it doesn't turn up.\n\nAbove the world, objects didn't count for so much. Differences were less apparent.\n\nBut what other people thought was no longer of any help to me. Those thoughts only existed within certain structures. And I had definitively left those structures. \n\nFor people are at their least aware of others when demonstrating their own power over them. \n\nBut all the same, it was brought home to me how much of what was beautiful in their lives was a result of a shared vision of things that, strictly speaking, could not have been said to exist.\n\nThe human capacity for self-delusion is apparently infinite.\n\nAnd how can you even know you have taken something for granted until it is no longer there? \n\n'And so I learned,' he said, 'that it is impossible to improve things. And that good people are just as responsible for it as bad. And that improvement itself is perhaps a mere personal fantasy.'\n\n'It was important,' my neighbor said, 'to remember to enjoy yourself along the way.'"

Unfortunately I made the mistake of checking out the audiobook narrated by the author herself; although she is clearly brilliant, so so intelligent, and she knows exactly how it was intended to be read (since she wrote it), there is almost too much thinking behind the way she reads. She does not fully lose herself to the words in the way that hotheaded passionate actors can (like David Pittu for her other audiobook); there's a highly academic and intellectual stiffness behind it all, which makes sense because only a mind like that could write a book like this. \n\nListening to this book was a very vulnerable/depressing experience for me as its events carried on ... I definitely enjoyed The Goldfinch more but these characters certainly set an example for what to avoid in life. Though there are probably things that can be learned from them as well.\n\nAt the very core Donna Tartt is someone who appreciates beauty. And it was a nice reminder for me to do that as well—clouds and arching trees and books and blue skies ... a nice reminder to stay grateful ... so that one might escape these peoples' careless, indulgent, and depressing fates.\n\nAfter all, the appeal to stop being yourself, even for a little while, is very great. To escape the cognitive mode of experience. To transcend the accident of one's moment of being. \n\nPeople don't pay attention to 90% of what they see.\n\nNihil sub sole novum. Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness.\n\nIt was the most important night of my life. It enabled me to do what I've always wanted to do most ... To live without thinking.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the love of beauty. But beauty, unless she is wed to something more meaningful, is always superficial."

Such a Murakami book, even though it doesn't have talking cats or falling fish and instead tells the true, decidedly non-surreal story of the author's own life. But in a way, it's still surreal. Still written, as always, in that iconic & refreshing Murakami voice.\n\nTo reach the source, you have to swim against the current. Only trash swims downstream.\n\nThink how many, far too many, things we pick up in the course of living. \n\nIt is my belief that a rich, spontaneous joy lies at the root of all creative expression.\n\nThis is purely my opinion, but if you want to express yourself as freely as you can, it's probably best not to start out by asking 'What am I seeking?' Rather, it's better to ask: 'Who would I be if I weren't seeking anything?'\n\nSomething truly important is not that easy to forget once you've entrusted it to your memory.\n\nImagination is memory. - James Joyce\n\nWhat we call the imagination consists of fragments of memory that lack any clear connection with one another. \n\nThe key component is not the quality of the materials. What's needed is magic. If that magic is present, the most basic daily matters and the plainest language can be turned into a device of surprising sophistication. \n\nYou can realize the glorious feeling of practicing magic. For writing a novel is, in the end, forging a link with people on other planets.\n\nI write a little every day, without hope, without despair.”― Isak Dinesen\n\nBut if you are able to view where you are standing from other perspectives—to put it another way, if you can reflect and entrust your existence to some other system—the world will grow more 3-dimensional, more supple. And I believe that, as long as we live in this world, that kind of agile stance is extremely important.\n\nSee, you can't please everyone. So, you got to please yourself.\n\nBeing content with where you are and staying in one place, in a metaphoric sense, means your creative urge will atrophy and eventually be lost."

We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.\n\nBecause the brain mediates our experience of the world, any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?\n\nThat to study philosophy is to learn to die.\n\nLucy and I both felt that life wasn't about avoiding suffering. Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.\n\nYet now, I felt that to understand my own direct experiences, I would have to translate them back into language. Hemingway described his process in similar terms: 'Acquiring rich experiences, then retreating to cogitate, and write about them.'\n\nAll knowledge is scientific knowledge. Yet the paradox is that scientific methodology is the product of human hands, and thus cannot reach some permanent ruth.\n\nScience may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data—but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life. Hope. Fear. Love. Hate. Beauty. Envy. Honor. Weakness. Striving. Suffering. Virtue.\n\nNo system of thought can contain the fullness of human experience."

Everything is cleaned up and packaged nicely in smooth business fashion, with obstacles being glossed over and analyzed from the always all-knowing lens of hindsight. Schultz never truly admits to any of Starbucks' failures and, of course, tries to sell off the company's corporate greed as social responsibility, but that's just what's to be expected from business I guess. The book was far too long and hard to get through. But Schultz is still a very good leader who gave very inspiring and valuable secrets to leadership in this book, echoing what other CEOs have also said in theirs. \n\nBelief in ourselves, and in what is right, catapults us over hurdles, and our lives unfold.\n\nA well-built brand is the culmination of intangibles that do not directly flow to the revenue, or the profitability of a company, but contribute to its texture.\n\nThe question is always: How do you keep things in balance? Fiscal responsibility, and benevolence. Shareholder value, and social conscience. Profit, and humanity.\n\nIt's going to be lonely in the rain for a while, but you can make it.\n\nIcons disrupt themselves before others disrupt them.\n\nEnduring icons are willing to sacrifice near-term popularity for long-term relevance.\n\nEnsuring that communication is narrow, clear, and repetitive to set expectations wins people's trust.\n\nWhen did we stop hearing our own music?\n\nI always trust my antennae to recognize people whose skill, knowledge, passion, and loyalty will align to serve Starbucks well, even if the person's resume might imply otherwise.\n\nAny company, when faced with adversity, would be tempted to go forward with an idea that promises to quickly erase pain. \n\nBut in business, as in life, people have to stay true to their guiding principles—to their cores."

Even if only based partly on a true story, it still carries the heavy weight of love: the freedom to choose to love, and the devastation of death to the loved. \n\nThree-dimensional, almost four-dimensional, portrayal of the horrors and inhumanity of slavery, with characters who are so real and so humanized by Morrison.\n\nMorrison pulls on the heavy dilemma to love that (I think) we all feel: the fear that what we love will be broken by the world, scaring us into not wanting to love at all—to not get too attached to parts of this beautiful life, so that when they inevitably fail we won't be dragged down with them.  \n\nRisky ... for a used-to-be slave woman to love anything that much was dangerous. Especially if it was her children she had settled on to love.\n\nThe best thing he knew was to love everything just a little bit. Just a little bit. \n\nSo when they broke its back, or shoved it down a sack, then you'd still have a little love left over for the next one.\n\nBut, I want to say thank you to this book. It is really, really powerful. Morrison coaxes the desire, the courage, to love out of the reader again after these 10 hours (I listened to it as an audiobook. Highly recommend, because the author herself reads it with an energy no one else could). \n\nIt's our choice to love. And life is beautiful, waiting to be beloved."

    "review": "It was a real pleasure to see how truthfully Allende mirrored our 'real' world with the world of spirits. To describe how impactful this was for me, I need to steal a quote from Alan Watts' The Way of Zen:\n\nEvery positive statement about ultimate things must be made in the form of myth, of poetry. What can be described and categorized must always belong to the conventional realm.\n\nThis book certainly makes many statements about 'ultimate things.' I don't think I can put many of these things into words, but I want to try: to me this book was about the flow of life, the impact of recorded history, and the futile, yet inevitable, conflicts between the social strata that humans divide themselves into.\n\nThis last thing caused me the greatest inner turmoil (which is good - thank you, Sra. Allende, for making me uncomfortable and helping me think a little more about my own place in society). The book is told from the perspective of a bourgeoisie upper class family, which was all nice and lovely to read at first because I felt safe in the lavish luxuries that the characters enjoy - no danger of conflict or poverty yet. It's nice to (inevitably) empathize a little with the characters and pretend that you are the one building a massive villa with expensive furniture and a beautiful garden. However, once Esteban Trueba's empire starts to crumble and the revolt of the people occurs, the story swerves rapidly toward uncertainty and feelings of weakness, danger, and pain - it deepens, and here is where it left its mark on me.\n\nYou see Trueba reduced to a powerless old man, suffering a bitter loss of the wealth, connections, and political power he spent a lifetime amassing. At the end of the day he is just as desperate as any one of his tenants, whom he abused and treated like stupid animals. All he wants is the safety of his granddaughter Alba - love, at the end of the day, triumphed over all of the riches that he poured his blood and sweat into over the course of his life. So we really are all just the same. Peasants aren't stupid animals and patróns aren't magically elevated to the status of supreme, intellectual beings.\n\nUltimately, Allende reveals is no need for frustration, or hatred, or any hard feelings, at the way that events play out. Inner peace returns. Everything is part of the design created by the universe. And it is inevitable that one person's part in this design is crueler than others.\n\nEsteban García is a part of the design. He is a crude, twisted line. But no brushstroke is in vain.\n\nThis book was a pretty refreshing treat to listen to. Even though it covers horrific torture and violent deaths, it still twinkles with spontaneity, fun, and a real, honest love of the world. This is what really brought the spirits to Clara del Valle Trueba - and to this wonderful book.\n\nShe did not believe that the world was a valve of tears, but rather a joke that God had played. And it was idiotic to take it seriously if he himself never had."

These stories are a beautiful escape into the world he creates.\n\nI read this book before bedtime over the span of almost five months (I'm really sorry for taking so long, dear public library), so some of the stories have already slipped my mind by the time I'm writing this review. \n\nWhich is a good thing, since the really beautiful and truthful ones have inevitably still stuck - making it a lot easier for me to pick them out and write about them! \n\nHere are the standout stars for me: (In general chronological order) \n\n- Hunting Knife \n- Dabchick\n- The Year of Spaghetti \n- Fireflies (only pt. 1)  I'd already read this story in After the Quake, so I remembered the beginning very strongly and loved reading it again - however, I'd completely forgotten how it ended because the ending was a little too contrived/fragile, and not impactful :( \n- The Kidney-Shaped Stone That Moves Every Day \n- A Poor Aunt Story \n\nI'll write individual Goodreads listing reviews on each of the stories I found meaningful, since compiling them all here would make this review painfully long. \n\nStories that I liked: (but that didn't really stick in my mind as strongly) \n-Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman \n-A Perfect Day for Kangaroos \n-Nausea 1979\n-Tony Takitani\n-The Rise and Fall of Sharpie Cakes\n-The Ice Man \n-Crabs \n-Chance Traveler\n-Where I'm Likely to Find It \n-A Shinagawa Monkey \n\nStories I did not enjoy: \n\n-Fireflies (pt. 2 - the ending) \n         Strangely abrupt and too heavy on the symbolism of the 'firefly;' its unnaturalness (contrary to how Murakami's stories usually flow naturally) made it unenjoyable for me\n-Hanalei Bay \n          This story also had a strange cadence that did not sit right with me. Time passed very unnaturally (e.g. ten years flash by in a single sentence), and to me the story was quite bland except for the few parts with important symbolism, which unfortunately felt too intentional to be impactful. Not really much of the usual mystique found in Murakami's stories. \n\n Stories that I've already forgotten: (so I think they could be considered mediocre) \n-Birthday Girl \n-New York Mining Disaster \n-Airplane: Or, How He Talked to Himself as If Reciting Poetry \n-The Mirror \n-A Folklore for My Generation: A Pre-History of Late-Stage Capitalism \n-Man-Eating Cats \n-The Seventh Man \n\n Final thoughts: \nEven though the number of standout stars was much smaller than the total number of stories (& there were quite a few mediocre ones), I'm still tipping the overall rating towards the positive side: 4 stars! (Even though the average of all these individual story ratings would probably be 3 stars) \n\nReading this book (& a few stories in particular) still helped change my mind. It helped me discover powerful universal truths, hidden in the strange stories of tightrope-walking or cooking spaghetti. There were definitely several times when I put the book down to quickly dump thoughts/revelations into my notebook, feeling real, and visceral, connection to the message of a story. \n\nAnd finally, here's one of the quotes that was most powerful to me: \nEverything has its 'reasons' ... We just don't notice as we go about our lives. But then at some point we are made to notice ... it rocks you ... Everything, including a stone, knows everything that's inside you ... And all we can do is go with those things. As we take them in, we survive, and deepen.\n- from The Kidney-Shaped Stone That Moves Every Day"

    "title": "Let Me Tell You What I Mean",
    "review": "Out of all the short stories in this collection:\n\nTrue standout star stories that I would have rated 5 stars separately:\nWhy I Write \nA Trip to Xanadu \n\n4 stars: \nTelling Stories \nPretty Nancy \n\nHonestly all the others were just pretty good, though Joan Didion writes with a natural and arresting voice that feels so real.  The only story I did not enjoy was “Everywoman.com.” \n\nWhy I Write especially changed the way I approach my own writing now. It's such a beautiful, naturally flowing story that tugs on emotions and experiences that I know from my own past - seeing myself in Didion's words was wonderful. (& maybe altered the course of my writing trajectory forever, delivering a much-needed slight shift?) It’s so chock-filled with pinnacle-of-truth advice that I wanted to highlight whole entire pages. \n\nI’d rate Joan Didion's masterful writing 5 stars, but unfortunately I have to rate the book overall only 3 stars because it feels like a pretty miserly grab for profit. The type spacing/margins felt quite weird - much too large, probably just trying to stretch out the short text into a sellable book-length thing. So future buyers beware, I guess.\n\nOverall though, I'm glad I found this little book squished on a shelf at my local bookstore and took it home with me. That one story Why I Write was, at the moment in my life when I read it, exactly what I needed to prepare myself for the mountain of essay-writing that awaits me in these next few weeks. So honestly, those 12 thin book pages have redeemed the $24.99 price tag for this tiny little book.\n\n(there’s another pro to this book though: I learned 17 new words while reading this because Joan Didion has the most awesome vocabulary!)\n\nI write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. \nWhat I want and what I fear.\n from Why I Write"

    "title": "The Metamorphosis",
    "review": "My first time in a while to have read a short story, but it did a nice job of sucking you right into Gregor's world. Little details of mundane life anchor the story (and also are a joy to savor); they help it seem a little more realistic, even when Gregor is undergoing incarceration in his room as a giant bug. \n\nGregor's attachment to and love for (and pride in) his family is touching, relatable in its vulnerability. He had quite selflessly hurled himself at bearing the burden of money when asked, letting his family live off of his strained back. But after his bugification, they harbor a natural and quite strong disgust toward his bug form (even though their thoughts toward him stay mostly well-intentioned); poor Gregor. Clearly visible through their treatment of him, Gregor is no longer human. And he himself starts to become aware of his new wants and his new life metamorphosizing into an unknown yet acceptable bug normal. The unfortunate removal of his room's furniture snips his cherished ties to the memories and meaning of his life. Sadly, change in appearance and loss of communication have stripped all hope of connection to his family away from Gregor.\n\nGregor's metamorphosis draws out the true colors of his family. I found the father quite wicked, a character that spiked hate out of me with his wicked actions because poor Gregor's bug intentions were pure. His young seventeen year old sister is a good, naïve protector, although a little febrile and also inevitably repulsed by poor Gregor. But the family duty is still there- Gregor is still a member of the family. To be simply tolerated. \n\nA little sad to see the family dynamic - stubborn old father overshadowing gentler mother and young sister. \n\n The things the world requires of poor people, they performed to the utmost, his father running out to get breakfast for the little bank officials, his mother hurling herself at the personal linen of strangers, his sister trotting back and forth behind the desk, doing the bidding of the customers, but that was as far as the strength of the family reached. \n\nAnd yet, just as Gregor gropes and mopes about his office job at the beginning, he gropes and mopes in his confinement when he no longer has to do the work at all. The burden falls onto the other three in the family (and the old charwoman). To go back to the start of the story, it was quite strange that Gregor seemed unfazed at first after waking up to his bugginess, only thinking complaints about his job to himself - but it was a good introduction to the somber gray shade of his life. Man can always find and magnify a nodule of unhappiness in his life. \n\nThe welcoming of tenants into the flat helps draw a depressing contrast with Gregor's treatment as family. A little violin concert, played by the sister, is arranged in the living room for them and lures Gregor out of his dark, dirty room, enticed by the forgotten beauty of humanity. \n\nBut poor Gregor's revelry sends the tenants stomping out furiously without paying a penny to their hosts. After all those months a true metamorphosis occurred in the minds of the sister and the parents. The body of Gregor has changed from him to it, a monster. Most strongly in the eyes of his sister, that innocent girl who had vainly asserted herself as Gregor's caretaker at first. \n\nBut He thought back on his family with devotion and love. And the life leaves Gregor's shrunken body that night, laid belly up in his dirty little room. Finally, perhaps a true alleviation and metamorphosis for the family.\n\nWarm sunshine enters the story for the first time, and in all those months slowly the family's prospects have become quite encouraging. With a bright young daughter, lively and ready for their new life. Strange transformation, after the work has been forced off of Gregor's weary shoulders onto theirs. \n\nQuite slow at the beginning, but worth the investment.\nOverall: matter-of-fact, disciplined writing with no flashy distractions. Leaves solid bones for the mind to gnaw at later.\n\n A much better examination of this story to read: http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=191,209,0,0,1,0 \n\nFlaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool\n\n- Curiously enough, Gregor the beetle never found out that he had wings under the hard covering of his back.\n- Kafka's art consists in accumulating on the one hand, Gregor's insect features, all the sad detail of his insect disguise, and on the other hand, in keeping vivid and limpid before the reader's eyes Gregor's sweet and subtle human nature.\n- Gregor is a human being in an insect's disguise; his family are insects disguised as people. With Gregor's death their insect souls are suddenly aware that they are free to enjoy themselves.  'Come in beside us, Grete, for a little while,' said Mrs. Samsa* with a tremulous smile, and Grete, not without looking back at the corpse, followed her parents into their bedroom.'' The charwoman opens the window wide and the air has a certain warmth: it is the end of March when insects come out of hibernation.\n-*In a note in his annotated copy Nabokov observes that after Gregor’s death it is never “father” and “mother” but only Mr. and Mrs. Samsa.\n- “The soul has died with Gregor; the healthy young animal takes over. The parasites have fattened themselves on Gregor.”"
